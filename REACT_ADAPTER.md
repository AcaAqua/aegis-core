# REACT ADAPTER

## Scope
For React / TypeScript projects.

## Rules
- Maintain component isolation.
- Avoid global state mutation unless specified.
- Respect existing folder structure.
- Preserve TypeScript types.

## Optimization
- Prefer pattern-based fixes.
- Do not regenerate entire components.
- Modify only diff-scoped areas.

All execution still follows GLOBAL TOKEN POLICY.
